This set of scripts use the Google Calendar API to schedule my coffee maker to turn on when I have an event on my calendar with title "make coffee".

It would be trivial to change any of these scripts to kick off other commands based on other calendar events.








addToQueue.sh                          Does the queueing, using the bash command 'at'
google_calendar_config.py              configuration file, real.  cp the example to this file and then customize
google_calendar_config.py.EXAMPLE      example configuration file. cp google_calendar_config.py.EXAMPLE google_calendar_config.py and then edit google_calendar_config.py
makeCoffeeManually.sh                  small script for kicking off coffee making manually (I used it for a web interface; php ran this shell script).
makeCoffee.py                          The script that actually runs on schedule.  It uses another script which controls wireless RF outlets (a personal choice of implementation).
queryCalendar.py                       script which logs in and parses Google Calendar. Calls addToQueue.sh if future event found.
queryCalendar_wrapper.sh               Wrapper script: sometimes queryCalendar.py doesn't work from cron.




execution flowchart:


queryCalendar_wrapper.sh  -->  queryCalendar.py  -->  addToQueue.sh  --> |bash 'at' program for scheduling|  |->  makeCoffee.py
